- The Psychology of everyday actions
    - seven stage: 
        - Goal(form the goal)
        - Plan(the action)
        - Specify(an action sequence)
        - Perform(the action sequence)
        - Percive(the state of the world)
        - Interpret (the perception)
        - Compare(the outcome with the goal)

- knowledge in the head and knowledge in the world
- knowing what to do:  constraints, discoverbility, and feedback
- human error vs bad design
- 
## element in design
- elegent conceptual model
    - affordances
    - signifiers
    - constraints
    - mappings  
        - knowledeg in the world and knowledge in the head
        - natural mapping
    - feedback

    - constraints :: type
    - mappings    :: (orthogonal function)
    - feedback    :: test repl, compile&run
