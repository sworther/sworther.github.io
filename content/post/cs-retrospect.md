# properties of a true high-level language
- Elegance: there is a simple, easily understood relationship between
the notation used by a high-level language and the concepts
expressed.
- Abstraction: each expression in a high-level language describes one
and only one concept. Concepts may be described independently and
combined freely.
- Power: with a high-level language, any precise and complete
description of the desired behavior of a program may be expressed
straightforwardly in that language.
